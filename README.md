# LocalGov Drupal Microsites

A repository for the LocalGov Drupal Microsites project.

As of 30th March, we are just starting a discovery sprint, so the respository is primarily for issues and requirements gathering at first.

Depending on the architecture, this repository may become the home for custom modules that deliver the new microsites functionality.
